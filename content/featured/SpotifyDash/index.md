---

A Spotify Dashboard project that provides users with insights into their listening habits and personalized playlist recommendations.

By leveraging the Spotify API, the application retrieves user data such as top tracks, favorite artists, and recently played songs. Additionally, it integrates the OpenAI API to generate custom playlists based on user preferences and listening history, offering a unique and tailored music discovery experience.

\*Pending approval from Spotify for the Spotify API, the application is currently in development and will be available for public use in the near future.
